                    <h2>What are Jaw Tumors and Cysts?</h2>
                    
                    <figure class="content-image">
                        <img src="https://placehold.co/350x250/2c5b85/ffffff?text=Panoramic+X-Ray" alt="Panoramic X-ray showing a large cyst in the lower jaw">
                        <figcaption>Cysts and tumors are often found on routine X-rays.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> Cysts are fluid-filled sacs, while tumors are solid masses of tissue that can develop in the jawbones (maxilla and mandible) or the soft tissues of the mouth. While the term "tumor" can sound frightening, many jaw tumors and almost all cysts are benign (non-cancerous). However, even benign growths can cause significant problems if left untreated.</p>
                    <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> These lesions can grow slowly, displacing teeth, weakening the jawbone, and leading to facial swelling or numbness. Dr. Bandyopadhyay specializes in the surgical management of these conditions, with the goals of completely removing the pathology, preventing recurrence, and preserving the structure of the jaw and teeth.</p>

                    <h2>Why is Treatment Necessary?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To prevent further damage to adjacent teeth and nerves</li>
                        <li>To reduce the risk of a pathologic jaw fracture due to bone weakening</li>
                        <li>To confirm the diagnosis and rule out malignancy</li>
                        <li>To stop the expansion of the lesion and relieve facial swelling</li>
                        <li>Some benign tumors can be locally aggressive and have a high rate of recurrence if not properly removed</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Surgical Approach</h2>
                    <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> The surgical technique used depends on the size, location, and type of the lesion, which is determined by imaging and often a biopsy.</p>
                    
                    <div class="expandable-content">

                            <h4>Enucleation and Curettage</h4>
                            <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> This is the most common approach for cysts and well-defined benign tumors. "Enucleation" means to remove the lesion whole, like "shelling out" a pea from a pod. This is often followed by "curettage," which involves carefully scraping the bony cavity to remove any remaining cells and reduce the chance of the lesion coming back. The resulting cavity often heals with new bone on its own, but sometimes a bone graft is needed to speed up the process.</p>

                            </figure>

                            <h4>Resection</h4>
                            <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> For larger or more aggressive benign tumors (like ameloblastoma), a more extensive surgery called resection may be required. This involves removing the tumor along with a margin of healthy surrounding bone to ensure all abnormal cells are eliminated. This creates a larger defect in the jaw that almost always requires immediate or staged reconstruction, often with a bone graft from the hip or a microvascular free flap.</p>

                            <h4>Post-Operative Care</h4>
                            <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> After surgery, the focus is on comfortable healing. We will provide instructions on oral hygiene and diet. The removed tissue is always sent for histopathological examination (biopsy) to confirm the final diagnosis. Regular follow-up with X-rays is crucial to monitor bone healing and to check for any signs of recurrence.</p>
