                    <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> Oral oncology is a specialized field focused on the diagnosis, surgical treatment, and reconstruction of cancers affecting the head and neck region. This includes cancers of the mouth (oral cavity), jaws, salivary glands, and surrounding structures. Dr. Bandyopadhyay is an integral part of a multidisciplinary team, working alongside medical and radiation oncologists to provide comprehensive care.</p>
                    <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> The primary goal is the complete surgical removal of the tumor while preserving as much function and form as possible. This is often followed by complex microvascular reconstructive surgery to rebuild the affected areas, ensuring the best quality of life for the patient after treatment.</p>

                    <h2>Key Aspects of Our Oncologic Care</h2>

                        <li>Accurate diagnosis and staging through biopsy and advanced imaging</li>
                        <li>Complete surgical removal (resection) of tumors with clear margins</li>

                        <li>Preservation of critical functions like speech, swallowing, and breathing</li>

                    <h2>The Patient's Journey</h2>
                    <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> A cancer diagnosis can be overwhelming. Our approach is to guide you through every step of the process with expertise, clarity, and compassion.</p>

                            <h4>Step 1: Diagnosis and Multidisciplinary Planning</h4>
                            <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> The journey begins with a definitive diagnosis, usually via a biopsy. Your case will be discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board, where experts from surgery, medical oncology, and radiation oncology collaborate to create the most effective treatment plan tailored to your specific cancer type, stage, and overall health.</p>

                            <h4>Step 2: Surgical Resection and Reconstruction</h4>
                            <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> The surgical phase typically involves two main parts performed in a single operation. First, the cancerous tumor is meticulously removed. Second, the defect created by the tumor removal is immediately reconstructed. This often involves microvascular free flap surgery, where tissue (skin, muscle, bone) is transferred from another part of the body (like the leg, arm, or back) to rebuild the jaw, tongue, or cheek. The tiny blood vessels of the flap are painstakingly connected to vessels in the neck under a microscope to ensure the transferred tissue lives and thrives.</p>

                            <h4>Step 3: Post-Operative Care and Rehabilitation</h4>
                            <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> Following surgery, patients are closely monitored in the ICU. The recovery process involves a dedicated team of nurses, dietitians, and therapists (speech, swallowing, physical) to help you regain function and adapt. Further treatment, such as radiation or chemotherapy, may be required based on the final pathology report. We remain a central part of your care team throughout your entire recovery.</p>
