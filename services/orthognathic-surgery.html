                    <p>Orthognathic surgery, also known as corrective jaw surgery, is a transformative procedure performed to correct a wide range of minor and major skeletal and dental irregularities, including the misalignment of jaws and teeth. It can significantly improve chewing, speaking, and breathing. While the patient's appearance may be dramatically enhanced as a result of the surgery, corrective jaw surgery is performed to correct functional problems.</p>
                    <p>The procedure involves surgically repositioning the upper jaw (maxilla), lower jaw (mandible), or both, to create a more balanced, functional, and healthy relationship. We utilize state-of-the-art 3D virtual planning to ensure the highest degree of precision and to help you visualize the outcome before the procedure even begins.</p>

                    <h2>The Process: From Planning to Recovery</h2>
                    <p>Your journey towards a healthier bite and balanced profile is a carefully planned process. It typically begins with a comprehensive consultation and may involve coordination with your orthodontist. Here is a summary of the steps involved.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Step 1: Initial Consultation & Planning</h4>
                    <p>During your first visit, we will conduct a thorough examination, including X-rays, photos, and 3D scans of your head. Using this information, we perform Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP) to simulate the entire procedure on a computer, allowing us to plan the precise movements and achieve a predictable, optimal result. We will discuss the plan with you in detail, ensuring all your questions are answered.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Step 2: The Surgical Procedure</h4>
                    <p>The surgery is performed in a hospital under general anesthesia. Most incisions are made inside the mouth to avoid visible facial scars. Depending on the case, we may reposition the upper jaw, lower jaw, and chin. The bones are held in their new position with small, biocompatible titanium plates and screws, which are designed to stay in place permanently beneath the gums.</p>

                    <h4>Step 3: Recovery & Post-Operative Care</h4>
                    <p>After surgery, you will spend time in the recovery room and may stay in the hospital for a day or two. Swelling is a normal part of the healing process and typically peaks around the third day. We will provide you with a detailed guide for post-operative care, including instructions for a modified (liquid and soft food) diet, oral hygiene, and managing discomfort. The initial healing phase takes about 6 weeks, but complete healing continues for several months. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor your progress.</p>
