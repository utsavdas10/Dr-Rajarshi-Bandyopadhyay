                    <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> Reconstructive surgery aims to restore form and function to parts of the body affected by trauma, cancer, or congenital defects. In the head and neck, this is a highly complex field that requires not only surgical skill but also an artistic eye. Dr. Bandyopadhyay specializes in advanced reconstructive techniques, particularly microvascular free flap surgery.</p>
                    <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> The goal is not just to close a wound, but to rebuild the structures in a way that allows a person to speak, eat, and appear as normal as possible. This involves transferring bone, skin, fat, and muscle from one part of the body to another, and re-establishing its blood supply under a microscope.</p>

                    <h2>Types of Reconstructive Procedures</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Microvascular Free Flaps:</strong> Transferring tissue with its own blood supply from a donor site (e.g., leg, arm) to the head and neck.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pedicled Flaps:</strong> Moving tissue from an adjacent area while keeping its original blood supply attached.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bone Grafting:</strong> Using bone from another part of the body (like the hip or leg) to rebuild the jaw or facial skeleton.</li>
                        <li><strong>Skin Grafts:</strong> Covering wounds with thin layers of skin.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Reconstructive Process</h2>
                    <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> Reconstruction is often performed at the same time as the primary surgery (e.g., tumor removal or trauma repair) to provide the best possible outcome in a single operation.</p>
                    
                    <div class="expandable-content">
                        <!-- This content is hidden by default -->
                        <div class="hidden-content">
                            <h4>Step 1: Pre-operative Planning</h4>
                            <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> This is the most critical step. Using advanced imaging and virtual surgical planning, we determine the exact size and type of defect that will be created. We then select the best donor site on the body that can provide the necessary tissue (bone, skin, etc.) with the least impact on the donor area. The entire surgery is simulated on a computer for maximum precision.</p>
                            
                            <figure class="content-image" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 0;">

                            </figure>

                            <h4>Step 2: The Two-Team Approach</h4>
                            <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> Reconstructive surgery is often performed with two surgical teams working simultaneously. One team focuses on removing the tumor or repairing the trauma in the head and neck. At the same time, the second team carefully harvests the free flap (the donor tissue) from the leg, arm, or back. This significantly reduces the total operating time.</p>

                            <h4>Step 3: Microvascular Anastomosis and Insetting</h4>
                            <p><strong>[PLACEHOLDER]</strong> Once the primary surgery is complete, the harvested flap is transferred to the head and neck. The surgeon, working under a high-powered microscope, painstakingly connects the tiny artery and veins of the flap to the recipient blood vessels in the neck. This "re-plumbing" restores blood flow to the new tissue. The flap is then shaped and secured (inset) to perfectly reconstruct the defect.</p>
